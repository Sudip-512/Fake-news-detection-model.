# Fake-news-detection-model.
This project aims to detect fake news using a Deep learning approach model. The model processes news articles and predicts whether the given news is real or fake.

## Features
- Preprocessing of data includes stopword removal, tokenization and prediction.
- Utilization of tensorflow, nltk and sklearn to implement in the model.
- Loss curve, Accuracy curve, confusion matrix and ROC curve (Receiver-operating characteristic curve) is used to prediction.

## Getting Started
