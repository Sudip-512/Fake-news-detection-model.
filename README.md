# Fake-news-detection-model.
This project aims to detect fake news using a Deep learning approach model. The model processes news articles and predicts whether the given news is real or fake.

## Features
- Preprocessing of data includes stopword removal, tokenization and prediction.
- Utilization of tensorflow, nltk and sklearn to implement in the model.
- Loss curve, Accuracy curve, confusion matrix and ROC curve (Receiver-operating characteristic curve) is used to prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above.
- Required libraries: `numpy`,`pandas`,`nltk`,`re`,`tensorflow`,`nlpaug.augmenter.word`,`matplotlib`,`seaborn`.

### Usage
1. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the root folder of the project and renaming it to `fake_and_real_news.csv`.
2. Run the main script to train the mode:
   ```bash
   python final_fake_news_prediction_using_ML_(1).ipynb
   ```
