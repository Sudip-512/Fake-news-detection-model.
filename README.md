# Fake-news-detection-model.
This project aims to detect fake news using a Deep learning approach model. The model processes news articles and predicts whether the given news is real or fake.
# Features
1. Preprocessing of data includes stopword removal, tokenization and prediction.
2. Utilization of tenserflow, nltk and sklearn to implement in the model.
3. Loss curve, Accuracy curve, confusion matrix and ROC curve (Receiver-operating characteristic curve) is used to prediction.
